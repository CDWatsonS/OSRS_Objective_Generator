# OSRS_Objective_Generator
Generates goals for you to complete in OSRS based on your current skills.


By storing your stats and quests completed in a CSV file (example given), this program will generate random skills
for you to train (90% of the time) and quests for you to complete that you have the requirements to complete (10% of the time). 

Future ideas:
Generate random diary tasks to complete.
Generate random events such as minigames and killing bosses.
